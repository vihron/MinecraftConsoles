## Introduction

This project contains the source code of Minecraft Legacy Console Edition v1.6.0560.0 (TU19) with some fixes and improvements applied.

## Download
Windows users can download our [Nightly Build](https://github.com/smartcmd/MinecraftConsoles/releases/tag/nightly)! Simply download the `.zip` file and extract it to a folder where you'd like to keep the game. You can set your username in `username.txt` (you'll have to make this file)

## Platform Support

- **Windows**: Supported for building and running the project
- **macOS / Linux**: The Windows nightly build may run through Wine or CrossOver based on community reports, but this is unofficial and not currently tested by the maintainers

## Features

- Fixed compilation and execution in both Debug and Release mode on Windows using Visual Studio 2022
- Added support for keyboard and mouse input
- Added fullscreen mode support (toggle using F11)
- (WIP) Disabled V-Sync for better performance
- Added a high-resolution timer path on Windows for smoother high-FPS gameplay timing
- Device's screen resolution will be used as the game resolution instead of using a fixed resolution (1920x1080)
- LAN Multiplayer & Discovery
- Added persistent username system via "username.txt"

## Multiplayer

Basic LAN multiplayer is available on the Windows build

- Hosting a multiplayer world automatically advertises it on the local network
- Other players on the same LAN can discover the session from the in-game Join Game menu
- Game connections use TCP port `25565` by default
- LAN discovery uses UDP port `25566`
- Add servers to your server list with the in-game Add Server button (temp)
- Rename yourself without losing data by keeping your `uid.dat`

Parts of this feature are based on code from [LCEMP](https://github.com/LCEMP/LCEMP) (thanks!)

3. Open the project by double-clicking `MinecraftConsoles.sln`.
4. Make sure `Minecraft.Client` is set as the Startup Project.
5. Set the build configuration to **Debug** (Release is also ok but missing some debug features) and the target platform to **Windows64**, then build and run.

### CMake (Windows x64)

```powershell
cmake -S . -B build -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A x64
cmake --build build --config Debug --target MinecraftClient
```

## Known Issues
